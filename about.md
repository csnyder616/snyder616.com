I live in the Garfield Park neighborhood in Grand Rapids, Michigan, with my wife and four kids.

I develop enterprise APIs for [Spectrum Health](http://www.spectrumhealth.org), a regional integrated healthcare system with over 25,000 employees.

I occasionally play organ and piano at my church, [Neland Ave CRC](http://www.neland.org).

I sing tenor in [The Choral Scholars](http://www.thechoralscholars.com), a group that feels like a second family.
