I have an amazing wife and two sons.

I am the Web Developer for [BioLogos](http://www.biologos.org).

I am the Interim Organist for [Hope Church](http://www.embracehopegr.org) in Grand Rapids.

I sing tenor in [The Choral Scholars](http://www.thechoralscholars.com), a group that feels like a second family.

I live in the [Garfield Park](http://www.gpnagr.org) neighborhood.

I operate [WavyGlass.org](http://www.wavyglass.org), a forum for old house enthusiasts.
