I don’t have any grand plans for this site. Mainly, it exists for me to collect random thoughts I have on a variety of topics—software development, politics, life in general, etc.—and write down what I’m thinking.

Also, this site will serve as a way for people interested in me (employers/clients, etc.) to get to know me.

Regardless of why you’re here, welcome. I hope you’re not expecting too much.
